## conky-bargile
Yet another conky-lua theme, this one includes some kind of an engine

This is another theme to use with [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) (with Lua support).
This theme will provide you a small engine to build a theme easily. It will also
provide a baseline theme as an example of what can be done.

### Documentation
It will have one some day. I'm sorry for the reverse-engineering that you will
have to do by now.

### History
I had a conky-lua theme to use on my system. Some friends asked me to use my
theme. My friends have different system's setup and they also found some bugs.
Every time I needed to update my theme I had to distribute it sending the theme
by e-mail or something. Now, one can download this, install, customize and
receive the update without my direct involvement.
